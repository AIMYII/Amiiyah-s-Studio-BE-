# Amiiyah's Studio [BE]
A free Bedrock add-on that allows modders to animate anything, with our example animations.


Tutorial:

Tools:
- https://github.com/Mojang/bedrock-samples/tree/main/resource_pack/animations - the animation folder, since it has the files that we can change.
- Bridge: https://bridge-core.github.io/. Optional, but useful for making JSONs and importing them into Minecraft.
- MCreator: Optional, but for making the RP and BPs.
- Blockbench: https://www.blockbench.net/, for making the custom player animations.
